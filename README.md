Learning Goals

Working through the course is a learning journey where the destination of achieving a result is less important then the learnings along the way. With this in mind here is a list of learning goals for this course. Use them as a measure of how you are doing and whether or not you can move onto the next chapter, even if you have not finished the current task you are on. The goal is to learn, so ask yourself "Do I understand the learning objective for this chapter" If the answer is yes then you should move onto the next part. 

If you are unsure call over a facilitator and ask them what they think about you moving on. Specific learning Goals will also be defined at the top of each chapter.
