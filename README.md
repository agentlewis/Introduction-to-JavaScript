Introduction-to-JavaScript
==========================

This Repository contains an introductory course for people to learn JavaScript and its place in the web today. The course is designed to be administered by a knowledgeable person and at key points it is expected that a group discussion will provide insights that are not provided for in the material. In other words this is a supplementary coarse :)


##Prerequisites
- Around one hour of light reading/watching beforehand
- <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95346?hl=en" target="_blank">Installation of Google Chrome</a>

Skim through the various branches of the course so you have an idea of what you will be doing on the day.</br>
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript" target="_blank">Read the introduction of this document</a> on the Mozilla Development Network. Please feel free to skim through the rest of the document - it contains a lot of what we will be covering in the coarse. So note down any questions you might have and bring them along.

##How to use this Git Repository
Firstly let me just say Git is awesome and in another lesson you will learn about its Awesomeness. So knowing that, it should be pointed out that this lesson uses Git and GitHub in a slightly different way to the norm - Git branches are being used as lesson chapters rather then version controlled development branches. The coarse will refer to these as branches to avoid confusion.

What this means is that as you complete one branch of work you then move to the next by selecting the next branch. Also note that the README.md will change from branch to branch describing the next steps for you to do. Also note the "master" branch is the root of the project and contains the introductory README.md, it is the branch you need to be viewing when you go to download the zip of the coarse.

To get started download the GitHub Repo as a zip and extract it where ever you would like to save your work. (its a button to the right)

On organising your code: Please add your files to the appropriate folder inside the "base" folder you extracted. When starting a branch the contents of the base folder will be your starting point. This means you will be able to concentrate on the learnings of each branch rather than having to get the code working a certain way.

##Guideline for asking for help
When asking help of someone, whether of a facilitator or fellow learner try to present the problem you are facing in a concise manner and ideally put forward any options you are dwelling upon. That way you will move on from the current learning problem as fast as possible and also practice this crucial form of efficient and logical communication.

##Learning Goals

Working through the course is a learning journey where the destination of achieving a result is less important then the learnings along the way. With this in mind here is a list of learning goals for this course. Use them as a measure of how you are doing and whether or not you can move onto the next branch, even if you have not finished the current task you are on. The goal is to learn, so ask yourself "Do I understand the learning objectives for this branch" If the answer is yes then you should move onto the next part. 

If you are unsure call over a facilitator and ask them what they think about you moving on. Learning Goals will be elaborated on at the top of each branch.

##Conceptual Ideas
